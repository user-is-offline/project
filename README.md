What happens to all of our digital "stuff" when we die? What can and should we do to prepare for it ahead of time?

## genesis

This is a WIP, thought about for years, but started in earnest after an online conversation with [irongeek_adc](https://twitter.com/irongeek_adc/status/999838152318734336). This could become a talk, or a reference manual for 'best practices' as we expand our online presence with an eye towards a time where we'll no longer be alive to shepard this content.
